Business Question:
Original business question was to predict what volume of Part 1 crime activity might a police district in Baltimore City expect for the most common Part 1 crimes based on day of week, date, time of day, holidays, neighborhood, location, temperature, precipitation, and other possible features. 

Through exploration of the Part 1 crime dataset from Baltimore City, adjusted business problem. The final business problem was to attempt to predict the daily volume of Part 1 crimes in Baltimore Cityâ€™s Northeast Police District based on features of the day. These features were the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.); whether the day was a holiday; the minimum, maximum, and average temperature; the average wind speed; the total precipitation; whether it was in the winter; and whether there was a thunderstorm, mist, or fog on the day.

Methodology to Answering the Business Problem:
Approach to this project was to follow the CRISP-DM methodology and to use supervised learning with regression models.

Data Understanding:
After drafting the business question, collected the Part 1 crime dataset from Open Baltimore City and the weather dataset from the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI). The crime dataset was in a usable format. However, the weather dataset needed processing to a usable format. 
Collected Part 1 crime data from Baltimore City and weather data from National Center for Environmental Information with NOAA.

The following shows the volume of crime in each district and the volume of each crime description.
